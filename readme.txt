there was a request to create a web portal to review performance of employees of small/medium (>500<1000 headcount) business
this sample website was proposed to the client but due to budget limitation, client cant proceed with the project.
moving forward, this project will be improvised and made it available to public at no upfront cost. just pay as they use to
cover for the server cost.

there are 2 portals, 1 for admin to kick start the process by providing key company stratergies.
https://www.blockrantai.dev/adminLogin.html
you can log into this site with username:nurulhanimyusof@gmail.com and password is test1234.

the second portal is for all employees to log in and provide their goals and submit. Before they can do this, they need to signup.

all user authentication and database are running on Firebase. 

to log into the portal, follow this link: https://www.blockrantai.dev/littleCaliphKPI.html
use the same password and username provided if you dont wish to signup
